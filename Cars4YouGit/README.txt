Cars4You: Car Price Prediction Project

This repository contains the Machine Learning project developed by Group 08 for the Machine Learning course

The objective of this project is to assist "Cars 4 You", a car resale company, in optimizing their vehicle evaluation process. By developing a predictive regression model, We aim to estimate the market price of a car based on its characteristics, reducing the dependency on physical inspections by mechanics and expediting customer service.


Project Goals
1.	Regression Benchmarking: Develop a robust regression model to predict the target variable `price`.
2.	Competition Submission: Generate predictions for the test dataset to compete in the class Kaggle challenge.
3.	Data Analysis: Perform comprehensive Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to understand market trends and feature correlations.
